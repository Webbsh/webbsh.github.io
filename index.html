    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutral" - A calming and focused palette using beige, slate, stone, and a subtle gold accent to represent the Olympic goal. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA. The top features key metric cards for the selected week (mileage, long run) and a phase selector. The main visual is an an interactive line chart of the 52-week mileage progression. Below, a "Weekly Detail" section dynamically updates with the full plan (running, strength, nutrition, recovery) for the selected week. This structure was chosen to provide a high-level overview (the chart) while allowing for easy drill-down into specific weekly tasks without information overload, which is ideal for a long-term, data-driven plan. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: 52-week mileage data -> Goal: Show change/progression -> Viz: Line Chart -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips, click to update details -> Justification: Best for time-series data, shows gradual build-up and recovery weeks clearly -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        - Report Info: Training Phases -> Goal: Organize/Filter -> Method: Interactive Buttons -> Interaction: Click to filter chart data -> Justification: Breaks the year into manageable chunks, reducing cognitive load -> Library/Method: JS + Tailwind.
        - Report Info: Weekly Plan Details -> Goal: Inform -> Method: Dynamic Text Blocks with Unicode Icons -> Interaction: Updates on week selection -> Justification: Clear, scannable format for instructions -> Library/Method: JS + HTML.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
